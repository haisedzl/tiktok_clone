# HELLO, WELLCOME TO PROJECT FOR ME, I'M HAISE
# sản phẩm vẫn đang trong quá trình hoàn thiện, chúc bạn có 1 buổi làm việc vui vẻ.

- trong project ngoài REACTJS  em còn sử dụng khá nhiều thư viện như : classname, sass, axios, tippy, normalize 
- em thực hiện project này dựa trên nguyên mẫu của tiktok hiện tại:
- các chức năng em xây dựng được :
- cấu hình router 1 cách hoàn chỉnh.
- xây dựng được chức năng tìm kiếm.
- về phần video : play, pause , tự động phát khi xuống video tiếp và tắt video đang xem ở trên.
- về phần iu thì gần như hoàn thiện mặt trang chủ, 
- Rất xin lỗi trong việc chậm trễ và thiết kế API, khiến cho bạn có trải nhiệm ko tốt
- em sẽ hoàn thành nó một cách sớm nhất có thể. cảm ơn bạn đã xem !!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
